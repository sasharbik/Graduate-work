# Anomaly detection in biomedical signals with RNN
This work was made as my bachelor thesis. The exploratory task was using LSTM-autoencoders to detect anomalies in ECG. Although automatization of medicine with Neural Network technologies is the main issue of this work, it is not the only one. This research is the first step to create an automated medical complex, that would be able to interpret biomedical signals. So the first part here is about signal processing.
